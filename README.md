# Chat With Multiple PDFs

##Project Description:
This project utilizes Streamlit and OpenAI's vector embeddings to read PDF documents and answer questions based on their content. For instance, using a US amendments PDF as an example, the model can interpret and respond to queries such as explaining the first three amendments in simple terms, suitable for a toddler's understanding.

##Key Details:

Functionality: The project leverages Streamlit for PDF reading and OpenAI's vector embeddings for understanding and processing queries.

Accuracy: It reliably provides answers to questions, stating "I don't have context to answer" when it encounters unfamiliar queries.

Speed: Responses are generated within 3 seconds, ensuring quick interaction.

Improvement Plans: Future plans include enhancing its conversational abilities and deploying the system on AWS for broader accessibility.
