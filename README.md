# Chat With Multiple PDFs

## Project Description:

The MultiPDF Chat App is a Python application that allows you to chat with multiple PDF documents. You can ask questions about the PDFs using natural language, and the application will provide relevant responses based on the content of the documents. This app utilizes a language model to generate accurate answers to your queries. Please note that the app will only respond to questions related to the loaded PDFs.
## Resources:
* [OpenAi](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
* [Langchian](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/)
* [Chatgpt](https://chatgpt.com/)
* [HugggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)

## Key Details:

**Functionality:** The system utilizes Streamlit for robust PDF parsing and integrates OpenAI's vector embeddings for advanced natural language understanding and query processing.

**Accuracy:** It provides reliable responses to queries, gracefully handling unfamiliar topics with a response indicating lack of context.

**Speed:** Responses are generated in under 3 seconds, ensuring rapid user interaction and feedback

**Improvement Plans:** Future enhancements aim to bolster conversational capabilities through advanced dialogue management techniques. Additionally, deployment on AWS is planned to expand accessibility and scalability.
