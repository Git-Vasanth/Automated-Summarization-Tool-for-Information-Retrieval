# Chat With Multiple PDFs

## Project Description:

This project utilizes Streamlit and OpenAI's vector embeddings to read PDF documents and answer questions based on their content. For instance, using a US amendments PDF as an example, the model can interpret and respond to queries such as explaining the first three amendments in simple terms, suitable for a toddler's understanding.

## Key Details:

**Functionality:** The project leverages Streamlit for PDF reading and OpenAI's vector embeddings for understanding and processing queries.

**Accuracy:** It reliably provides answers to questions, stating "I don't have context to answer" when it encounters unfamiliar queries.

**Speed:** Responses are generated within 3 seconds, ensuring quick interaction.

**Improvement Plans:** Future plans include enhancing its conversational abilities and deploying the system on AWS for broader accessibility.
